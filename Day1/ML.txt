Hello, so a basic about what is ML. Well firstly ML stands for Machine Learning. It provides learning to the artificial intelligence(AI). ML comes under AI. By the ML and AI are not the same. AI is for decision making. Since our machine is dumb, we have to provide some learning to it. There are many techniques and approaches to ML. 
1.	Supervised learning: it’s a learning provided to the machine with a known set of data i.e. a labelled dataset( like these images are of ford mustang,etc). There are 2 kinds within it, one known as regression and another classification. Regression is the technique that aim to reproduce the output value for example predict some product price whereas Classification is the !technique that aim to reproduce the class assignment.it can predict the response value and the data is separated into class.
2.	Unsupervised learning: think of it as if the machine is learning on its own with the data it already has. Again there are 2 kinds, one is clustering and another association. A clustering problem is where you want to discover the inherent groupings in the data, such as grouping customers by purchasing behavior. An association rule learning problem is where you want to discover rules that describe large portions of your data, such as people that buy X also tend to buy Y.
3.	Reinforced learning: Think of it as like this- when we get an output for some input, the same goes in again as an input. Its like recursion of learning. It’s a well renowned type of learning nowadays as it is found useful in various cases like spam detection , web search engines, photo tagging method etc.
This a basic about ML as far as my knowledge is concerned. Hope you understood.
